-	Small blue relay

	-	powers AC/DC converter.

	Green push button will bypass this relay to force
	the power on. Pull up resistor will then ensure that the
	small blue relay stays powered on.

	Pressing the red button (long enough -- we could add a
	capcitor) will disengage the relay.

	Pulling D2 high for a bit will do the same.

-	Black relay - controlled by D8.

	Switches power.

-	GREEN led in green push button is hard wired to 
	output of AC/DC converter.

-	RED led in the red push button is wired to D3.

-	RFID reader is wired to standard SCK, MISO 
	and MOSI (D5,6 and 7). The SS(SDA) is wired
	to D0 and the IRQ to D1. Its reset is not
	wired up.

-	The black push button is a wemos reset.

-	The red switch forces the relay.

-	The current coils goes to A0 (not really
	protected or anything).
